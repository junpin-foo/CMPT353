1. Although their syntax looks to be quite similar so essentially they're both equally difficult or easy to work with, but pandas produces a cleaner looking output compared to numpy array matrix, therefore pandas makes its easier to read.

2. Pandas took 14.8 ms ± 68.3 µs per loop, whereas python loop took 259 ms ± 928 µs per loop. Pandas looks to be far more efficient compared to using loops in python, pandas is robust in sorting out larger data files, where as loop has to create its own array and store it individually.
