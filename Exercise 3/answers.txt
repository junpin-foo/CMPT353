1. I belive I got a better result with Kalman smoothing, we can observe that Kalman smoothing provides more details as it takes into account
    points that are further more the general cluster. Especially in certain peaks across the plot, Kalman is able to show off the data points that are furthre 
    away whereas loess ignores them as it gives weights to different data points.

2. I think these data can also help weed out inaccurate data points. For example, if a person was travelling at a close to linear speed, a sudden spike in speed would 
    indicate an inaccurate capture of data. This will help us find a more realistic lattitude / longitude. thus providing a better prediction.
